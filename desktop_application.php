                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Desktop applications offer several advantages over web applications, including superior performance for complex tasks, better access to system resources, enhanced security for sensitive data, offline functionality, and deeper integration with the operating system. They're ideal for tasks that require intensive processing, handling large datasets, frequent file system operations, or specialized hardware integration. However, the choice between desktop and web applications depends on your specific business needs, and we can help you determine the best approach for your project.</p>
